## CORE APP FEATURES

## Likert Scoring

Rate records on multiple dimensions using standardized Likert scales to provide quantitative quality assessments.

### What is Likert Scoring?

Likert scoring is a standardized rating method where you evaluate records on specific dimensions using numeric scales (typically 1-7). This creates quantitative data for analysis and comparison.

**Common Dimensions**:
- **Realism** (1-7): How realistic/believable is the content?
- **Quality** (1-7): Overall quality of the content
- **Helpfulness** (1-7): How helpful is this response?
- **Accuracy** (1-7): Factual correctness
- **Clarity** (1-7): How clear and understandable?

### Accessing Likert Scoring

1. Navigate to **Core App**
2. Click **Likert Scoring** in the sidebar
3. You'll see the scoring dashboard

### Scoring Interface

**Record Display**:
- Full record content displayed prominently
- Record metadata (type, category, project)
- Context information if available
- Previous scores (if already rated)

**Rating Scales**:
- Each dimension shows 1-7 scale
- Hover over numbers for descriptions
- Click number to assign score
- Visual indicators show current selection

**Scale Interpretation**:
- **1-2**: Very Poor/Strongly Disagree
- **3-4**: Poor to Fair/Disagree
- **5**: Neutral/Acceptable
- **6-7**: Good to Excellent/Agree

### Scoring Workflow

**Step-by-Step**:
1. **Read Content Carefully**
   - Read the entire record
   - Understand context and intent
   - Consider project guidelines

2. **Evaluate Each Dimension**
   - Rate Realism: How believable?
   - Rate Quality: Overall assessment
   - Rate additional dimensions as shown

3. **Add Comments (Optional)**
   - Explain your ratings
   - Note specific issues or strengths
   - Provide context for extreme scores

4. **Submit Score**
   - Click **"Submit"** button
   - Score is saved permanently
   - Move to next record

5. **Review Next Record**
   - System automatically loads next record
   - Progress indicator shows completion

### Scoring Best Practices

**Be Consistent**:
- Use the same criteria for all records
- Define what each number means to you
- Apply standards uniformly
- Re-calibrate periodically

**Be Objective**:
- Focus on content, not personal preference
- Follow project guidelines
- Remove bias from ratings
- Consider intended audience

**Be Thorough**:
- Read complete content before scoring
- Don't rush through records
- Take breaks to maintain focus
- Re-read if uncertain

**Document Reasoning**:
- Add comments for borderline scores
- Explain very high or very low ratings
- Note anything unusual
- Help future reviewers understand

### Scoring Calibration

**Why Calibrate?**
- Ensures consistency across raters
- Aligns understanding of scale
- Reduces rater bias
- Improves data quality

**Calibration Sessions**:
1. Group of raters score same records independently
2. Compare scores and discuss differences
3. Align on criteria and scale interpretation
4. Adjust scoring approach based on feedback

**Self-Calibration**:
- Periodically re-score past records
- Check consistency with previous scores
- Identify drift in your ratings
- Recalibrate your mental scale

### Batch Scoring

**Efficient Workflow**:
1. Filter records by project or category
2. Work through entire batch in one session
3. Maintain consistent mindset
4. Take short breaks every 20-30 records

**Progress Tracking**:
- Dashboard shows total records assigned
- Progress bar indicates completion
- Filters show scored vs. unscored
- Statistics update in real-time

### Understanding Your Scores

**View Your History**:
- Access scoring history from dashboard
- Filter by date, project, dimension

- Review patterns in your ratings

**Score Statistics**:
- Average scores per dimension
- Distribution of your ratings
- Comparison to other raters
