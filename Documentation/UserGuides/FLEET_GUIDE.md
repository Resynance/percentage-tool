## FLEET APP FEATURES

> ⭐ **Your Primary Workspace**: The Fleet App is your main management hub.

## Data Ingestion

Import task and feedback data into the system from CSV files or API endpoints.

### What is Data Ingestion?

Data Ingestion is the process of loading external data (prompts, feedback, evaluations) into the Operations Tools database for analysis and quality assurance.

**Data Sources**:
- **CSV Files** - Bulk upload from spreadsheets
- **API Endpoints** - Automated data sync from external systems
- **Manual Entry** - Single-record creation (for small datasets)

### Accessing Ingestion

1. Navigate to **Fleet App**
2. Click **Ingest** in the sidebar
3. Choose ingestion method: CSV Upload or API Sync

---

### CSV Ingestion

Upload spreadsheet data in bulk.

**Preparing Your CSV**:

Required Columns (at least one):
- `content` or `feedback_content` or `prompt` - The actual text
- `task_id` or `id` - Unique identifier (prevents duplicates)

Optional Columns:
- `category` - TOP_10, BOTTOM_10, or STANDARD
- `type` - TASK or FEEDBACK
- `created_at` - Timestamp
- `created_by_name` - Creator name
- `created_by_email` - Creator email
- `metadata` - JSON string with additional data

**CSV Format Example**:
```csv
task_id,content,category,type,created_at
001,Write a function to validate email addresses,TOP_10,TASK,2026-01-15
002,Fix the bug in user authentication,BOTTOM_10,TASK,2026-01-16
003,Great explanation of the algorithm!,STANDARD,FEEDBACK,2026-01-17
```

**Upload Process**:

1. **Select Project**
   - Choose existing project from dropdown
   - Or create new project first (see Project Management)

2. **Choose File**
   - Click **"Choose File"** or drag-and-drop
   - Select your CSV file
   - File size limit: Usually 10MB

3. **Configure Options**
   - **Auto-detect Type**: Infer TASK vs FEEDBACK from content
   - **Auto-detect Category**: Classify as TOP_10/BOTTOM_10 from keywords
   - **Skip Duplicates**: Ignore records with existing task_id
   - **Vectorize After Upload**: Generate AI embeddings (recommended)

4. **Review Preview**
   - System shows first 10 rows
   - Verify columns mapped correctly
   - Check for format errors

5. **Start Ingestion**
   - Click **"Start Ingestion"**
   - Job begins processing
   - Progress bar shows real-time status

**Monitoring Progress**:

The ingestion job has two phases:

**Phase 1: Data Loading (Fast)**
- Inserts records into database
- Validates data format
- Checks for duplicates
- Status: PROCESSING → QUEUED_FOR_VEC
- Duration: Seconds to minutes

**Phase 2: Vectorization (Slow)**
- Generates AI embeddings for semantic search
- Batches of 25 records
- Requires AI service (LM Studio or OpenRouter)
- Status: VECTORIZING → COMPLETED
- Duration: Minutes to hours (depending on volume)

**Progress Indicators**:
- **Records Processed**: 847 / 1,000
- **Percentage**: 84.7%
- **Estimated Time Remaining**: 8 minutes
- **Current Status**: VECTORIZING
- **Errors**: 3 (view details)

**Handling Errors**:
- Click **"View Errors"** to see skipped records
- Common errors:
  - Duplicate task_id (already exists)
  - Missing required fields (no content)
  - Invalid format (malformed JSON metadata)
  - Keyword mismatch (doesn't match project criteria)

**Post-Ingestion**:
- Records immediately available in QA App
- Vectorization continues in background
- Similarity search works after vectorization completes
- Job status shown in Ingestion History

---

     - `api.prompt_text` → `content`
     - `api.unique_id` → `task_id`
     - `api.quality_flag` → `category`

3. **Set Schedule**
   - Manual trigger only
   - Hourly sync
   - Daily at specific time
   - Custom cron expression

### Ingestion Best Practices

**Data Quality**:
- ✅ Include unique task_id for deduplication
- ✅ Provide created_at timestamps
- ✅ Use consistent category naming
- ✅ Validate CSV format before upload

**Performance**:
- ✅ Upload during off-hours for large files
- ✅ Split very large files (>100k records)
- ✅ Enable vectorization in separate job if urgent
- ❌ Don't upload while other jobs running

**Error Prevention**:
- ✅ Test with small sample first (100 rows)
