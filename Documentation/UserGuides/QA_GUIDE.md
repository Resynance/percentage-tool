## Similarity Search

Find records similar to a given text using AI-powered semantic search.

### What is Similarity Search?

Similarity search uses AI embeddings to find records with similar **meaning**, not just matching keywords. For example, searching "handle errors gracefully" will find records about error handling, exception management, and fault tolerance - even if they don't use those exact words.

### Using Similarity Search

1. Navigate to QA App → **Similarity Search**
2. Enter your search query in the text box:
   - Can be a full prompt
   - Can be a short phrase
   - Can be keywords
3. Select **Project** (optional - leave blank to search all projects)
4. Set **Number of Results** (default: 20)
5. Click **"Search"**

### Understanding Results

**Result Display**:
- Records ranked by similarity score (0.0 to 1.0)
- **Higher score** = More similar
- Similarity score shown as percentage (e.g., "87% similar")

**Result Card Shows**:
- Record content (truncated)
- Similarity score with visual indicator
- Record type and category
- Project name
- Created date

**Interpreting Scores**:
- **90-100%**: Extremely similar, near-duplicates
- **75-89%**: Highly similar, same concept
- **60-74%**: Moderately similar, related topics
- **Below 60%**: Somewhat similar, weak connection

### Use Cases

**Find Duplicates**:
- Search for existing record content
- High similarity scores (>90%) indicate duplicates
- Helps prevent redundant entries

**Discover Patterns**:
- Search for a concept
- Find all records discussing similar ideas
- Identify common themes across projects

**Quality Control**:
- Search for problematic patterns
- Find all records with similar issues
- Bulk review related records

**Research**:
- Explore how specific topics are handled
- Compare approaches across projects
- Learn from high-quality examples

### Advanced Tips

**Query Crafting**:
- ✅ Use natural language: "How do I handle authentication?"
- ✅ Be specific: "React component state management"
- ❌ Don't use single words: "auth" (too vague)
- ❌ Don't use boolean operators: "AND", "OR" (not supported)

**Filtering Results**:
- Search within specific project for focused results
- Increase result count to cast wider net
- Lower result count for high-precision matches

**Performance**:
- Similarity search requires vectorized records
- Only records with embeddings are searchable
- New records need vectorization (happens automatically)

## Top/Bottom 10 Review

Review and analyze the highest and lowest quality records for quality assurance.

### What are Top/Bottom 10?

Projects often identify their best (TOP_10) and worst (BOTTOM_10) examples:
- **TOP_10**: Exemplary records to learn from and replicate

## Alignment Comparison

Evaluate how well records align with project guidelines using AI-powered analysis.

### What is Alignment Comparison?

Alignment Comparison uses AI to evaluate records against project-specific guidelines (uploaded as PDF). The AI acts as a "Quality Assurance Analyst" and provides:
- Alignment score (0-100)
- Detailed analysis
- Specific guideline violations
- Suggested improvements

### Prerequisites

**Required**:
- Project must have guidelines PDF uploaded (Fleet managers do this)
- Record must be ingested into the system
- AI service must be configured (LM Studio or OpenRouter)

**Not Required**:
- Record does not need quality scores
- Record does not need to be vectorized

### Running Alignment Analysis

1. Navigate to QA App → **Records**
2. Find the record to analyze
3. Click the record to open details
4. Click **"Generate Alignment Score"** button
5. Wait for AI analysis (10-30 seconds)
6. View results in the detail panel

**Alternative Path**:
1. Go to QA App → **Compare**
2. Enter Record ID
3. Click **"Analyze"**

### Understanding Results

**Alignment Score (0-100)**:
- **90-100**: Excellent alignment, follows all guidelines
- **75-89**: Good alignment, minor issues
- **60-74**: Acceptable alignment, some violations
- **40-59**: Poor alignment, significant issues
- **Below 40**: Very poor alignment, major violations

**Score Badge Colors**:
- 🟢 Green (90+): Excellent
- 🔵 Blue (75-89): Good
- 🟡 Yellow (60-74): Acceptable
- 🟠 Orange (40-59): Poor
- 🔴 Red (<40): Critical

**Analysis Sections**:

1. **Guideline Alignment Score**
   - Numeric score with explanation
   - Overall assessment

2. **Detailed Analysis**
   - Which guidelines were followed ✅
   - Which guidelines were missed ❌
   - Specific examples from the record
   - Context and reasoning

3. **Suggested Improvements**
   - Specific changes to make
   - Guideline references
   - Priority recommendations
   - Expected impact

### Using Analysis Results

**Quality Assurance**:
- Review low-scoring records
- Identify systematic issues
- Prioritize improvements
- Track quality over time

**Training**:
- Use analysis as teaching tool
- Show specific violations
- Demonstrate improvements
- Create before/after examples

**Guideline Refinement**:
- Identify frequently violated guidelines
- Find unclear or outdated rules
- Recommend guideline updates
- Improve guideline clarity

**Reporting**:
- Export analysis for reports
- Track alignment trends
- Show improvement over time
- Justify resource allocation

### Regenerating Analysis

If guidelines change or you want a fresh evaluation:

1. Open the record with existing analysis
2. Click **"Regenerate"** or similar button
3. Confirm regeneration
4. New analysis replaces the old one

⚠️ **Note**: Regeneration overwrites previous analysis - no undo.

### Cost Considerations

**OpenRouter (Cloud AI)**:
- Each analysis costs tokens (typically $0.01-0.05)
- Cost displayed after analysis completes
- Balance shown in dashboard header
- Large records cost more to analyze

**LM Studio (Local AI)**:
- Free (uses local compute)
- No cost limits
- Slower than cloud AI
- Privacy-first (data stays local)

### Best Practices

**When to Analyze**:
- ✅ New records before approval
- ✅ Records flagged for quality issues
- ✅ Sample records for trend analysis
- ❌ Don't analyze every record (expensive/slow)

**Interpreting Scores**:
- Don't rely solely on numeric score
- Read the detailed analysis
- Look for specific guideline violations
- Consider context and nuance

**Taking Action**:
- Use insights to improve current records
- Train team on common violations
- Update guidelines if needed
- Track improvement over time

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### "Cannot generate alignment score"

**Possible Causes**:
- Project has no guidelines PDF uploaded
- AI service is not configured
- OpenRouter balance is zero
- LM Studio is not running

**Solutions**:
1. Check project has guidelines (contact Fleet manager)
2. Verify AI service in Admin → AI Settings
3. Check OpenRouter balance in header
4. Ensure LM Studio is running (if local AI)

### "Similarity search returns no results"

**Possible Causes**:
- Records not vectorized yet
- Search query too specific
- Project has no records
- Vectorization job still running

**Solutions**:
1. Check ingestion job status
2. Wait for vectorization to complete
3. Broaden your search query
4. Try searching different project

### "Top/Bottom 10 is empty"

**Possible Causes**:
- Project has no categorized records
- Records not marked as TOP_10 or BOTTOM_10
- Wrong project selected

**Solutions**:
1. Verify project has data
2. Check Records page for category counts
3. Contact data source about categorization
4. Try different project
